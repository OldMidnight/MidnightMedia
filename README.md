# MidnightMedia: By OldMidnight

## Description
This module allows you to easily and systemless-ly switch media such as boot animation and UI sounds, ringtones etc from other devices. No need to go to recovery as everything is done from your terminal. 

After flashing, type 'midmedia' in a terminal to begin.

## Information
By using this module:
* The need for multiple media zips on your device is removed
* The mod cleans up itself meaning after downloading and applying the media it deletes all related files

#### Note:
* All files available in this module are all being hosted by me, so the list of available assets will be maintained regularly and updated.
